# healing-dystopias
Two classic works of science fiction, formatted for 8.5" x 11" printing &amp; binding as a book.

The full text of both E. M. Forster's *The Machine Stops* and Cordwainer Smith's *Scanners Live in Vain* are available for free online, but this repository has both as cleaned and slightly re-formatted .tex files. Note that the latter work initially had numbered sectoins: section names are new as of 2014, and were added to better match Forster's presentation.

This repo also has an editor's note as a separate .tex file, and a wrapper that includes all three, generating a .pdf with frontmatter. This .pdf may be further processed to place four pages on each letter-sized sheet of paper, for folding into quires and binding into a book. Both the source and the compiled .pdf are provided in both cases.
