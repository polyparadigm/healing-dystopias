This work may also be in the public domain in countries and areas with longer native copyright terms that apply the rule of the shorter term to foreign works.

%I'm checking for a copyright renewal on the short story "Scanners Live in Vain", by Cordwainer Smith. It was first published in a magazine, Fantasy Book, in 1950; the copyright on that magazine was not renewed. The copyright on the short story itself was not individually renewed, and it doesn't appear in any copyright renewal records with Smith's pseudonym or real name in them.--Grendelkhan, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Grendelkhan
